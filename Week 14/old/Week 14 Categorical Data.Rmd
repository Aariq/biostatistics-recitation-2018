```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, #don't show messages or warnings

```

To Do:

 - side-by-side and stacked bar plots in ggplot? (See deer example and soccer example from lecture. Makes sense for context 1 contingency analysis). Add at end.
 - Odds ratio (I think reported by `g.test()` or `chisq.test()` maybe?)
 
# Goodness of fit

## Chi-square
Using already tabulated data.  By default, the `chisq.test()` function wants observed values and expected probabilities.

```{r, out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Figure_12_03_02.png")
```

```{r simple chi square}
#Actual
Obs <- c(yellowround = 93, yelowwrinkled = 28, greenround = 31, greenwrinkled = 8)

#Expected probabilities
Exp.p <- c(9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16)
chisq.test(Obs, p = Exp.p)
```
**NOTE:** You *must* used a named argument for `p =`! `chisq.test(Obs, p)` will give you **different results**.

But you can also give it expected values or expected proportions if you include `rescale.p = TRUE`
```{r chi square with expected numbers}
#Expected values
Exp <- c(yellowround = 90, yelowwrinkled = 30, greenround = 30, greenwrinkled = 10)
sum(Obs) == sum(Exp)

chisq.test(Obs, p = Exp, rescale.p = TRUE)

#Expected ratio
props <- c(9, 3, 3, 1)
chisq.test(Obs, p = props, rescale.p = TRUE)
```

## Exact binomial test
If there are only two categories, you can use a binomial test.  Here's an example from the help file of `binom.test()`:

> Under (the assumption of) simple Mendelian inheritance, a cross between plants of two particular genotypes produces progeny 1/4 of which are "dwarf" and 3/4 of which are "giant", respectively. In an experiment to determine if this assumption is reasonable, a cross results in progeny having 243 dwarf and 682 giant plants. If "giant" is taken as success, the null hypothesis is that $p = 3/4$ and the alternative that $p ≠ 3/4$.

Conover (1971), p. 97f.
```{r binomial test}
binom.test(c(682, 243), p = 3/4)
```
Data are in agreement with the null hypothesis

## G-test
There is no G-test for goodness-of-fit available in R, and it's so easy to calculate by hand!  R is a really good calculator to use because it is *vectorized*.  That is, when you multiply a vector by a number, the operation applies to all elements of a vector.  This will make it easy to calculate everything inside the summation.
$$
G = 2\bigg[\sum_i{O\ln\bigg(\frac{O}{E} \bigg)} \bigg]
$$
### Define observed and expected
```{r}
#data from dihybrid cross
Obs #observed numbers
Exp.p #expected probabilities
#calculate expected numbers from probabilities
Obs.sum = sum(Obs)
Exp = Obs.sum * Exp.p
Exp
```
### Calculate G
To calculate every 
```{r}
OEratio = Obs/Exp #creates a vector from two vectors by dividing the first element of Obs by the first element of Exp, the second by the second, etc.
OEratio
G = sum(log(OEratio)*Obs) * 2
G
```

### Find p-value
Look up the p-value from the chi squared distribution using `pchisq()`
```{r}
p = pchisq(G, length(Obs) - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```

### Making a g-test function
First, put all the code together
```{r}
Obs.sum = sum(Obs)
Exp = Obs.sum * Exp.p
G = sum(log(Obs/Exp)*Obs) * 2
G
p = 1 - pchisq(G, length(Obs) - 2)
p
```

Then select it and choose "Extract Function" from the "Code" menu.  When prompted, call it "mygtest".
```{r}
#after extracting it as a function
mygtest <- function(Obs, Exp.p) {
  Obs.sum = sum(Obs)
  Exp = Obs.sum * Exp.p
  G = sum(log(Obs/Exp)*Obs) * 2
  G
  p = 1 - pchisq(G, length(Obs) - 2)
  p
}
```
Now you should see a new function called "mygtest" in the Environment tab to the right.  You can now use your function on new data.

```{r}
mygtest(Obs = c(85, 25, 30, 20), Exp.p = c(9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16))
```
Notice that it only displays the last thing printed out in the code of the function.  We can make it show both the G test statistic and the p-value by using `return()`
```{r}
mygtest <- function(Obs, Exp.p) {
  Obs.sum = sum(Obs)
  Exp = Obs.sum * Exp.p
  G = sum(log(Obs/Exp)*Obs) * 2
  G
  p = 1 - pchisq(G, length(Obs) - 2)
  p
  return(list(G = G, p = p))
}

mygtest(Obs = c(85, 25, 30, 20), Exp.p = c(9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16))
```
Save this and feel free to use it on your take-home!

# Contingency Analysis
Context 1: Fixed number of individuals assigned to or included in 2 or more groups (categorical explanatory variable).  Measure categorical response variable.  Column or row totals are predetermined.  Stacked bar plots might make more sense for this.

Context 2: Random sample with 2 categorical variables measured on each subject.  Only n is fixed, any observation can have any combination of the two categorical variables.

## Contingency Tables
The first step in contingency analysis in R is to convert a tidy data frame, in which each row is an observation and each column is a variable (in this case, both columns are a factor), into a contingency table where rows represent one factor and columns represent another.  This can be done with the `table()` function.

### Starting with frequency data (Context 1)

If you already have frequency data, you can use `xtabs()` with a formula interface to create a contingency table object.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
angina <- tribble(~Treatment, ~Symptoms,     ~Freq,
                  "Timelol",  "No_Angina", 44,
                  "Timelol",  "Angina",    116,
                  "Placebo",  "No_Angina", 19,
                  "Placebo",  "Angina",    128)
write_csv(angina, "Angina.csv")
```

Angina treatment data from lecture.  This shows every combination of treatment and symptoms and how many people fall into each group.
```{r}
angina <- read.csv("Angina.csv")
angina
```


```{r}
angina.table <- xtabs(Freq ~ Treatment + Symptoms, data = angina)
# Freq ~ Treatment + Symptoms can be read as "frequency distributed as Treatment and Angina status"
angina.table
addmargins(angina.table)
```

### Starting with "tidy" data (Context 2)

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## NOT RUN ##
worm <- read.csv(url("http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/WhitlockSchluter/wp-content/data/chapter09/chap09e4WormGetsBird.csv"))
worm$fishID <-  seq(1:length(worm$infection))
worm <- worm %>% select(fishID, everything())
worm <- worm %>% rename(bird_predation = fate)

write_csv(worm, "WormGetsBird.csv")
```

Example 9.4 from the text. Are fish infected by a trematode worm eaten or not?

```{r}
worm <- read.csv("WormGetsBird.csv")
worm
```

In this data set, each row is a fish and the columns tell you whether each fish was uninfected, lightly infected, or highly infected and whether it was eaten or not.

```{r}
worm.table <- table(worm$bird_predation, worm$infection) #first argument is the rows, second is the columns
worm.table #contingency table
addmargins(worm.table) #add row and column sums to display
```

### Exercise 1: Starting with contingency tables
There isn't a way to directly enter a contingency table into R.  You'll need to convert the frequencies you see in the table into a different format to read it in.

Enter this contingency table into R.  Hint: use Excel and save as a .csv, then read it in as usual or use `tribble()` from the `tibble` package.
```{r}
library(tibble)
df <- tribble(~factor1, ~factor2, ~freq,
              "A",      "YES",    35,
              "A",      "NO",     22,
              "B",      "YES",    55,
              "B",      "NO",     100)
df
```

Answer:
```{r}
snails <- tribble(~predation, ~color,     ~freq,
                  "Broken",   "Banded",   182,
                  "Broken",   "Unbanded", 116,
                  "Intact",   "Banded",   403,
                  "Intact",   "Unbanded", 385)
snails
snails.table <- xtabs(freq ~ color + predation, data = snails)
addmargins(snails.table)
chisq.test(snails.table)
```

Or:
```{r starting with matrix}
snail.matrix <- matrix(c(182, 403, 116, 385), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
snail.table2 <- as.table(snail.matrix)
rownames(snail.table2) <- c("Banded", "Unbanded")
colnames(snail.table2) <- c("Broken", "Intact")
snail.table2
addmargins(snail.table2)
chisq.test(snail.table2)
```

## Releveling Factors

By default, when made into a factor, R uses alphabetical order.  This order usually isn't important but can affect the appearance of plots (e.g. mosaic plots and barplots) and some statistical analyses (e.g. Dunnett's Test).

```{r}
snails$color <- as.factor(snails$color)
snails$color
levels(snails$color)
#first observation is "Banded", first level is "Banded"

#manually set levels
snails$color <- factor(snails$color, levels = c("Unbanded", "Banded"))
snails$color
#first observation is still "Banded" doesn't change data.  First level is "Unbanded"

#DON'T do this:
# levels(snails$color) <- c("Unbanded", "Banded")
#That just re-names the levels.  It will change the underlying data!!!
```
Watch out for typos!  R will **not** give an error message when using this method.

```{r}
test <- factor(snails$color, levels = c("Ubanded", "Banded"))
test
```

If you're doing a lot of work with categorical data, I highly recommend the package `forcats`. It has many fucntions for re-ordering levels different ways (by frequency, by some function of another column, in reverse order, etc.) 


```{r}
library(forcats)
fct_reorder(snails$color, snails$freq) #re-order the color factor by the frequency column
```


## Chi-square
Chi-square tests can also be used for contingency analysis. To conduct a chi-square test of independence first, you convert a data frame to a contingency table using `xtabs()`.  Then use `summary()` on that table to get chi-squre results.  You could also use `chisq.test()` on the table. By default, chisq.test uses the **Yates correction for continuity** (see ?chisq.tes() and page 251 of your textbook). Set `correct = FALSE` to get the same results as `summary()`. 

```{r}
summary(worm.table)
chisq.test(worm.table, correct = FALSE)
```


## G-test
There are no base R functions for G-tests, but functions for contingency table analysis with G-tests are found in a few packages including `DescTools` (`GTest()`) and `RVAideMemoire` (`G.test()`). However, rather than having you install a whole package just for one function we can use the function provided by Brent Larget, recommended by your textbook authors.

```{r}
source("http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~st571-1/gtest.R")
#source works kind of like library(), but for single .R files instead of packages.
```

After running the code above, you should see a new function in your Environment tab, `g.test()`.  This function also works on contingency table objects.

```{r}
g.test(worm.table)
```
Reject null hypothesis.  There is an association between worm infection and predation by birds.

## Fisher's Exact Test

Fisher's exact test (`fisher.test()`) is for 2x2 contingency tables with small n. It also works on contingency table objects.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
vampire <- read.csv(url("http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/WhitlockSchluter/wp-content/data/chapter09/chap09e5VampireBites.csv"))
write_csv(vampire, "VampireBites.csv")
```
Example 9.5 in your text. Do vampire bats prefer to feed on cows in estrous?
```{r}
vampire <- read.csv("VampireBites.csv")
vampire.table <- table(vampire$bitten, vampire$estrous)
vampire.table
```

```{r}
fisher.test(vampire.table)
```
Reject null hypothesis, vampire bats prefer cows in estrous

## Stacked bar plots
The base R function `barplot()` works on contingency table objects
```{r}
barplot(angina.table, legend.text = TRUE)
# We probably want the treatment on the x-axis.  Transpose the data with t()
barplot(t(angina.table), legend.text = TRUE,
        xlab = "Treatment",
        ylab = "Frequency (number of patients)")
```

ggplot always needs a data frame, so we have to start with the frequency table
```{r}
#plotted as frequency
ggplot(angina) +
  geom_col(aes(x = Treatment, y = Freq, fill = Symptoms))
```


## Mosaic plots
The `mosaicplot()` function also works on contingency table objects.
```{r}
mosaicplot(worm.table)
#that looks not so great.  For plotting, let's switch the axes

mosaicplot(worm.table,
           dir = c("h","v")) #controls how to split the boxes (vertical, then horizontal by default).  See help file for more info.
```
We can pretty it up and make it more visually informative by adding colors.

```{r}
mosaicplot(worm.table,
           dir = c("h","v"),
           color = c("firebrick", "goldenrod2", "lightgoldenrodyellow"),
           xlab = "Infection Status",
           ylab = "Bird Predation",
           main = NULL) #remove main title

#for a list of valid color names:
# colors()

#R also understands hex codes:
# mosaicplot(worm.table,
#            dir = c("h", "v"),
#            color = c("#FF0202", "#FFA602", "#FFF502"),
#            xlab = "Infection Status",
#            ylab = "Fate",
#            main = NULL)
```

#### Exercise: Make a mosaic plot
Using the snail data you entered earlier, make a mosaic plot, and make it your own with colors and labels! Try to figure out what other graphical parameters you can change.
```{r}
(snails.result<-summary(snails.table))
mosaicplot(snails.table,
           color = c("aquamarine4", "goldenrod1"),
           border = "purple",
           xlab = "Snail Color Pattern",
           ylab = "Predation",
           main = "Bird Predation and Snail Shell Pattern",
           sub = paste0("X^2 = ",
                        round(snails.result$statistic, 4),
                        ", p = ",
                        round(snails.result$p.value, 4)),
           cex.axis = 1.5,
           las = 1)


```


### Mosaic plots in ggplot2
There is also a `ggmosaic` package which provides `geom_mosaic()` to ggplot. For our purposes, `mosaicplot()` is so simple that we're not going to cover a ggplot way of making moasic plots.  For more advanced mosaic plots, however, you may find `ggmosaic` helpful.
